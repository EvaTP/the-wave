          Founded in 1991 by two passionate surfers, <strong>Johnny </strong>{" "}
          and <strong>Bodhi</strong>,{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>The Wave </strong>
          </em>
          was born to create a place where surfers from around the world could
          share their experiences and discover the best spots to ride.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          The name
          <em>
            <strong> The Wave </strong>
          </em>
          is a tribute to the endless search for that perfect swell ‚Äì the kind
          of wave that pushes surfers to travel across continents, explore new
          horizons, and connect with others who share the same passion.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Learning to surf is a long and demanding process, both physically and
          mentally. It takes time, patience, and resilience before one can truly
          feel at ease among the waves. At
          <em>
            <strong> The Wave</strong>
          </em>
          , we encourage perseverance: progress may be slow, but every wipeout
          brings you closer to that moment of pure joy when you finally ride
          with confidence.
          <br></br> <br></br>
          Above all, The Wave is built on the <strong>values </strong> of the
          surfing community: love and respect for nature, respect for others and
          for oneself, listening to your body, and knowing when to stop to
          prevent injuries. Surfing reminds us that every ride is a lesson in
          humility and courage.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Our goal is not only to help you find waves but also to inspire a
          mindful approach to surfing, one that celebrates the ocean and the
          people who share it.
